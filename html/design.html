   <h2>Design Principles</h2>
   <!-- ***********************************************
Each design principle needs three items:
1- The principle's name and the team member responsible for it.
2- An image (screenshot) of the mobile browser screen showing the design principle in use.
3- A discussion of how the design principle is exemplified in the picture. Be detailed but keep it to one paragraph!

   <h3>Proximity &mdash;

   <p>
       With this screenshot of the site, we see that when the user presses SPORT, the dropdown list of many sports comes to view. This is an example of good proximity because it allows the user easily find their sport, and they don’t have to search all over the place for what they are looking for. All the sports are placed closely together. A bad example of proximity is if the site threw all different sports throughout the site with no grouping.

   <h3>Alignment &mdash;

   <p>
       The alignment illustrated on the page makes it easy to navigate and everything feels neat and organized. Your eyes are drawn to particular parts of the page and it is all in place. The drop down menus aligned at the top of the page make it easy to change the items shown on the page. The navigation bar always stays at the top of the page makes it easy to access other parts of the website. The size and length of the bar make it convenient and not too big and annoying. All the items on the page are aligned the same way and this pattern makes it very user friendly.

       Adidas does a very good job of having contrasting colors on their mobile website. The majority of the website is black and white with a little bit of some gray thrown in. The black and white contrasting colors makes everything very easy to read and to focus on. The slight bit of gray helps to contrast between different selections or menus you can choose from. When you scroll to the bottom of the page they use a very bright blue to bring your attention to an email box. Using very simple, contrasting colors they are keeping our attention on their products and we are not distracted by anything else. They also use contrasting alignments. These different alignments make the buttons easier to read and also more interesting because then the whole page isn’t just left aligned.

   <h3>Typography &mdash;

       Adidas has an excellent contrasting theme. They use a Sans serif font throughout their site, changing the weight and color of the text. They use the most extreme contrast of black and white, using a heavier weight in section headings. Headings and footers are center aligned. Other content such as navigation and product information are left aligned. The text is clear, professional, and easy to read, while still adding style to advertise the product. They use different formats and weights of the font to help guide the user where they want to go.
